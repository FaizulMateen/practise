            <p>There once was an old miser who lived in a house with a garden. The old miser used to hide all his gold coins under stones in his garden. Every night, before he went to bed, the miser went out into his garden to count his coins. He continued
                the same routine every day, but he never spent a single, golden coin.</p>
